# Note Taking Page - Full Stack MERN

## **Description:**

This is a full-stack note-taking application. I got the inspiration from [Code with Ahsan](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodewithAhsan). I replicate the structure of the frontend from Ahsan and I did all the work for the backend. This is my first project that I apply MERN stack using MongoDB atlas, Express.js | Node.js and React.js with TypeScript and JavaScript.

### Technologies used:

- HTML | CSS
- MERN (MongoDB | Express.js | React.js | Node.js)
- JavaScript | TypeScript
- JSX | TSX

### Concepts in the project:

- Web development
- React
- Components web development
- Dynamic website
